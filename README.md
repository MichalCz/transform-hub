## Intro

The readme file contains information about the development process of the CSI. It is focused mainly on a day by day commands. Commands won't work as long as you don't set up the environment correctly. You can [find setup instructions in the docs.](https://github.com/scramjet-cloud-platform/docs/blob/main/developers-instructions/README.md)

## Basic commands

```bash
yarn build          # Build all packages
yarn bic            # Build only the changed components
yarn lint           # Check and fix syntax
yarn watch          # Watch files
yarn lint:dedupe    # Check if there are packages to deduplicate
yarn pack:pre       # Move linked packages to dist/ (alias: yarn prepack)
yarn pack:pub       # Prepare (unlink) packages for publication and move to dist/
```

## Start host

```bash
yarn start                          # Starts host after it's been built
node dist/host/bin/start            # This is the same as above
ts-node packages/host/src/bin/start # This starts node from source code
```

## Lerna commands

[See more lerna commands =>](https://github.com/scramjet-cloud-platform/docs/blob/main/developers-instructions/lerna-commands.md)

## Clean build

```bash
yarn clean
yarn install
yarn build:all-packages    # optionally build:all if you want all dockerfiles.
lerna run prepack              # moves files to ./dist/
```

## Docker commands

[See day by day Docker commands =>](https://github.com/scramjet-cloud-platform/docs/blob/main/developers-instructions/configuration.md#docker-commands)

## Install host and execute

```bash
npm install -g ./dist/host # installs packages globally
scramjet-host              # starts host
```

## Run components

### Runner

Starting `Runner` script: `/scramjet-csi-dev/packages/runner/src/bin/start-runner.ts`

Example of usage:

```bash
node dist/runner/bin/start-runner.js sequence-file-path fifo-files-path
```

### HostOne

Starting `HostOne` script: `./packages/host-one/src/bin/start-host-one.ts`

Example of usage:

```bash
node dist/host-one/bin/start-host-one.js sequence-file-path config-file-path
```

## Sequences and samples

To run sequence / sample (example Alice), first, you need to install all the dependencies, [install and execute host](#install-host-and-execute), compress the package, and then you're good to go and use curl commands.

> **HINT:** The following instructions apply to the state of the repository from the `release/0.10`.

### Compress the package

The sequence in a `tar.gz` file format with package.js (aka package) can be generated in different ways.

Assuming that you have the [host running](#install-host-and-execute) use command:

```bash
yarn packseq # this creates tar.gz for all packages in the repo
```

When the host is not running you can use a script:

```bash
lerna run prepare-sample-tar
```

To compress specific package use linux tar command:

```bash
tar czf <package-name.tar.gz> <path to file / folder >
```

### "Hello Alice" sample

To execute the sample run the commands from the level of the main folder:

```bash
lerna run clean && lerna run build && lerna run prepack

```

If the sequence is not packed:

```bash
lerna run prepare-sample-tar
```

> HINT: remember that to use curl commands host must be running.  [See how to execute host =>](#install-host-and-execute)

Now upload the package:

```bash
SEQ_ID=$( \
    curl -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' \
    --data-binary '@packages/samples/hello-alice-out.tar.gz' \
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence" | jq ".id" -r \
)
```

Start the sequence and see the output from it.

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw '{"appConfig": {},"args": ["/package/data.json"]}' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/$SEQ_ID/start | jq ".id" -r)
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/instance/$INSTANCE_ID/stdout"
```

as a result you should see something like this in the console:

```bash
sequence: [10D[10C[from monitoring] [ 4000, {} ]
Hello Alice!
Hello Ada!
Hello Aga!
Hello MichaÅ‚!
Hello Maciek!
Hello Marcin!
Hello Patryk!
Hello RafaÅ‚!
```

after that hit enter and type kill to exit the process:

```bash
sequence: kill
```

## How to run tests

Make unit and bdd tests via command:

```bash
yarn test
```

It will execute:

```bash
yarn test:parallel && yarn test:bdd
```

### Unit tests

```bash
yarn test:packages
```

### BDD tests

The following instructions apply to the state of the repository from the `release/0.4`.
BDD tests are located in a `bdd` folder, to execute them there are several steps to follow:

- start with:

```bash
yarn install &&
yarn build &&
yarn build:docker &&
yarn prepack &&
cd packages/pre-runner &&
yarn prepare-sample-tar &&
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) &&  # this line will throw you back to the main folder
```

- go to `bdd` folder:

```bash
cd bdd
```

- run `npm i`

```bash
npm i
```

- execute all bdd test using from the command line:

```bash
yarn test:bdd
```

- or execute a particular bdd scenario by adding the scenario title after a `--name` flag:

```bash
yarn test:bdd --name="Execute example HelloAlice"
```

Results of the performed test will be displayed in the console. There is also a report generated in `html` which illustrates the results in a very user friendly form. Html report is generated every time we run a bdd test, those html's are saved in `bdd` folder.

As an outcome, Lerna should go through all packages. If you see the error along the way, that means some tests were not passed.

```bash
lerna success run Ran npm script 'test' in 17 packages in 26.1s:
lerna success - @scramjet/adapters
lerna success - @scramjet/api-client
lerna success - @scramjet/api-server

Done in 26.66s.
```

## Publish

To perform full publishing of packages with build and install perform
the following commands:

```bash
# <clone>
yarn cache clean           # optional clean cache
yarn install               # install dependencies
yarn build:all-packages    # build all packages
yarn bump:version          # bump version and docker images prior to publishing
yarn bump:postversion      # prepare dist folder, publish packages from dist, push git tags
```
